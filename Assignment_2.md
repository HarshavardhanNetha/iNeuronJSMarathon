1. What is lexical structure?
- The first phase of building a compiler is Lexical Analysis.
- That is the phase where, the code, character stream is converted to tokens/lexemes.
- The reason I quoted the example is, every language has it's own set of rules for any definitions or usage.
- Be it syntax, be it the rules of definition, be it scope, use of brackets, semi-colons etc.
- Lexical structure in short means the description of a language in terms of all the above mentioned rules.

2. What is Unicode?
- Unicode is the actual representation of any character that do not have it by default in the set of alphabet (Eg. Emojis, special symbols etc) in machine understandable form.
- i.e Representing things which doesn't exist with the characters that exist.

3. Explain all the keywords present in the JavaScript with examples.
- There are total of 46 keywords in JS.
- Explaning everything takes much time to type. :|
-  
4. What are shorthand operators, explain with a suitable example?
- Shorthand operations mean, while assigning the updated value to the same variable instead of writing x = x+1, it's written in shorthand notation like x += 1
- Ex. y \*= 10 -> translates to y = y\*10
5. What is “use Strict” in JavaScript?
- Use strict is a literal which tells the execution to be done in Strict Mode only.
- In which the rules can be more stringent like we can't use undeclared variables.
```
"use Strict"
a = 10; // throws error 
```
