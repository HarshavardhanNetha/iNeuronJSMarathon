1. Explain the use of JavaScript ( or What you can do using a JavaScript)
- Javascript is more like a programming language. Whatever we can do with a typical programming language can be done using JS.
Web Development
APIs Development
Client-Side Code
Server-Side Code
DOM Manipulation
Solving DSA questions
are some classic examples of what can be done using JS.

2. What is the difference between client-side and server-side?
- In simple terms, Client-Side is front-end, runs on end users machine.
- Server-side is back-end, runs on the server which is being requested by end user for a response.
- Some part of code, which we need to maintain privately can be added in server-side, whereas code added client-side will be public and more proned to manipulation.

3. What is Nodejs?
- NodeJS is a javascript runtime environment.

4. Explain Scope in JavaScript
- Scope in technical terms means, the availability of a variable, or the bounds of a variable.
- Variables, based on it's place of declaration in code, can be accesseble Globally, within the block, etc.
- That shows us the real use case of scope.

5. JavaScript is asynchronous or synchronous.
- Javascript is synchronous.

6. JavaScript is Single-threaded or Multi-threaded.
- JS is Single-threaded.
 
7. Explain DOM in your own word.
- Document Object Model, inshort DOM, is the structure of front-end of a webpage. 
- All the elements in a page rendered, will have objects defined hierarchically.
- That's how DOM is built.
